</ul>
<h2><strong>14. Dispute Resolution</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>14.1 Informal Resolution</strong></h3>
<p>Before filing any arbitration or legal claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:stillful.app@outlook.com">stillful.app@outlook.com</a> with a written description of the dispute, including your name, account email, and the specific relief sought. </p>
<p>Within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice, you and Stillful agree to attempt resolution through informal negotiation, which may include a telephone or video conference if either party requests one. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled during this informal resolution period. </p>
<p>If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days, either party may proceed to arbitration as described below. Completion of this informal resolution process is a mandatory prerequisite to initiating arbitration.</p>
<h3><strong>14.2 Binding Arbitration</strong></h3>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY - THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>Except where prohibited by law, any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the App will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court. This includes disputes related to privacy, data security, or intellectual property.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitration is mandatory</strong> for covered disputes  </li>
<li><strong>You waive your right to a jury trial</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>You waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit</strong>  </li>
<li>The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA)  </li>
<li>The arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act  </li>
<li>Each party will bear their own costs, except as provided in AAA rules</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>14.3 Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></h3>
<p>You or we may still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring an individual action in small claims court  </li>
<li>Seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property infringement</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>14.4 Opt-Out of Arbitration</strong></h3>
<p>You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to 30 N Gould St Ste N, Sheridan, WY 82801 US within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, address, email, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<h3><strong>14.5 Class Action Waiver</strong></h3>
<p><strong>WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND STILLFUL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong></p>
<p>If this class action waiver is found invalid or unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement is void, and disputes will be resolved in court as specified below.</p>
<h3><strong>14.6 Governing Law and Venue</strong></h3>
<p>If arbitration does not apply, these Terms are governed by the laws of Wyoming, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any litigation will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Sheridan County, Wyoming, and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts.</p>
<h3><strong>14.7 Mass/Coordinated Arbitrations</strong></h3>
<p>If twenty-five (25) or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Stillful by the same or coordinated counsel, or are otherwise coordinated (&quot;Coordinated Claims&quot;), the AAA&#39;s procedures and fee schedules for mass arbitrations shall apply. Coordinated Claims shall be resolved by written submissions alone, without live witness testimony, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. You acknowledge that resolution of Coordinated Claims may require additional time.</p>
<h2><strong>15. General Provisions</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>15.1 Entire Agreement</strong></h3>
<p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Stillful regarding the App and supersede any prior agreements.</p>
<h3><strong>15.2 Modifications to Terms</strong></h3>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting the updated Terms in the App  </li>
<li>Sending you an email or push notification  </li>
<li>Requiring you to accept the updated Terms to continue using the App</li>
</ul>
<p>Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
<h3><strong>15.3 Severability</strong></h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3><strong>15.4 No Waiver</strong></h3>
<p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.</p>
<h3><strong>15.5 Assignment</strong></h3>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms and our rights and obligations at any time without notice to you.</p>
<h3><strong>15.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries</strong></h3>
<p>These Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights except as expressly stated.</p>
<h3><strong>15.7 Force Majeure</strong></h3>
<p>We are not liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquake, pandemics or public health emergencies, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, governmental actions, platform or third-party service outages</p>
