<h2><strong>4. Advertising and Analytics</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Universal Opt-Out Signals:</strong> Where required by applicable law, we recognize Global Privacy Control (GPC) and similar universal opt-out signals as valid requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes to the extent such signals are technically available to us in a mobile app environment. Because the App is a native mobile application, such signals may be limited to the specific device or context in which they are received.</p>
<p>We work with third-party advertising and analytics services to help us understand how the App is used and to display advertisements.</p>
<p>These services may collect information such as advertising identifiers, IP address and approximate location, device and operating system information, ad interaction data, and app usage metrics. Video advertisements may also collect playback and interaction events, such as when a video ad is loaded, viewed, completed, or skipped.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics:</strong> when analytics is enabled, we collect usage metrics such as session start times, durations, completion rates, practice selections, feature usage, and error events. You can control analytics participation through in-app privacy settings.  </li>
<li><strong>Advertising:</strong> the App may display rewarded video or other advertisements. You may choose whether to receive personalized or non-personalized ads. Declining personalized ads does not reduce the number of ads shown.</li>
